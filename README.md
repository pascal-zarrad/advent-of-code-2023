Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] project created by [pascal-zarrad][github].
In this repository you will find my solutions to Advent of Code[^aoc] 2023 challenges. 
There is no guarantee that you will find all solutions here, as I just continued as long as I had fun.

The challenges are solved using the Go programming language!

## Running challenges
Please run the challenges with your current working directory being the root of this repository.
The utilities used for by my challenge template expect this.
